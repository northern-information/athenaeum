# NORNS ATHENAEUM

This is a repository of study, spike, and sample scripts [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). Each was created as a means to learn different techiques or technologies myself. I am sharing it in the event others find them inspiring or useful.

- **delay.lua** - explores the concept of MIDI delay. Control rate and decay level of MIDI notes and get visual feedback as notes are toggled on and off. Requires an outboard MIDI device, preferrably one capable of polyphony. Made as a research spike for a new [arcologies](https://github.com/tyleretters/arcologies) structure.
