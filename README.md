# NORNS ATHENAEUM

A repository of study, spike, and sample scripts for [norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). Each was created as a means to learn different techniques or technologies myself. I am sharing it in the event others find them inspiring or useful.

## Scripts

- **delay.lua** - explores the concept of MIDI delay. Control rate and decay level of MIDI notes and get visual feedback as notes are toggled on and off. Requires an outboard MIDI device, preferably one capable of polyphony. Made as a research spike for a new [arcologies](https://github.com/tyleretters/arcologies) structure.
